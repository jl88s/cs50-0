### Harvard CS50 - Lecture 0 - Scratch

It has been a year since I first started this journey on taking Harvards' Computer Science 50 course. Things happened in my life and I wasn't able to continue with the course. However, since I have a winter break from my school now is the perfect time to start back again. 

In Lecture 0, David Millan gives us a brief description on what the class entails and what Computer Science is about. He opens the class prompting us to think about what is **Computer Science?** Simply put, > *CS* is fundamentally problem solving.
